# Toyota-DreamDrive


Toyota DreamDrive is an AI-powered web platform built to transform how people search, compare, and finance Toyota vehicles. Inspired by Toyota’s global vision to lead the future of mobility, DreamDrive helps users find their perfect car through personalized recommendations based on lifestyle, driving preferences, and budget.

The platform allows users to explore Toyota’s lineup through a sleek, interactive interface, compare models side by side, and calculate real-time financing or leasing options. It features a premium, modern design with smooth animations, dynamic filters, and intelligent search capabilities, all aimed at making the car-shopping experience simple, engaging, and highly personalized.

We built DreamDrive using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and a robust backend powered by Python and Node.js. The system integrates AI models for personalized car suggestions and natural language assistance, while external APIs provide accurate pricing, financing, and vehicle data.

Some challenges we faced included integrating multiple data sources, maintaining real-time performance, and ensuring the interface remained responsive across all devices. These challenges helped us learn how to optimize for speed, scalability, and user experience while maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase.

We’re proud of how Toyota DreamDrive brings together design, data, and AI to make mobility smarter and more accessible. In the future, we plan to expand it into a mobile app, add augmented reality car previews, and integrate with in-car systems for real-time recommendations and connected driving experiences.
